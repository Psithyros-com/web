    <h2>AI Integration & Services Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><b>Nature of AI Outputs</b></p>
    <p>Client acknowledges that Psithyros integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies into its software solutions. These systems utilize probabilistic models to generate outputs, predictions, and automated responses ("Outputs"). Client understands and accepts that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Probabilistic Nature:</b> AI models generate Outputs based on patterns in training data and do not possess true understanding or consciousness.</li>
        <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Outputs may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased.</li>
        <li><b>Hallucinations:</b> AI may generate "hallucinations"—content that appears factually correct but is entirely fabricated.</li>
        <li><b>No Professional Advice:</b> Outputs generated by AI integrated by Psithyros do not constitute legal, medical, financial, or professional advice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Independent Verification</b></p>
    <p>Client agrees that it is their sole responsibility to human-verify and "sanity-check" any AI-generated Output before relying on it for critical business operations, legal compliance, or public distribution. Psithyros shall not be liable for damages resulting from the Client’s failure to validate AI Outputs.</p>
    <p><b>Third-Party Model Providers</b></p>
    <p>Psithyros often integrates third-party Large Language Models (LLMs) and APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock). Client acknowledges that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Psithyros does not control the underlying logic, training data, or uptime of these third-party models.</li>
        <li>Changes made by these third-party providers to their models, APIs, or terms of service may affect the functionality of the integrated solution.</li>
        <li>Psithyros is not responsible for any service interruptions, data breaches, or performance degradation caused by these third-party providers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Data Privacy and Training</b></p>
    <p>While Psithyros implements best practices for data masking and "Opt-Out" configurations, Client is responsible for ensuring that no sensitive, regulated, or personally identifiable information (PII) is submitted to AI models in violation of the Client’s own privacy obligations or governing laws.</p>
    <p><b>Non-Infringement of AI Outputs</b></p>
    <p>Due to the evolving legal landscape regarding AI-generated content, Psithyros makes no guarantee that the Outputs generated by integrated AI systems are eligible for copyright protection or that they do not inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.</p>
    <p><b>Limitation of Warranty</b></p>
    <p>Psithyros disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding the fitness of AI-integrated systems for a particular purpose. Psithyros shall not be held liable for any "model drift" (the degradation of model performance over time) or for any offensive or inappropriate content generated by the AI.
